# WindSurf Rules Configuration
# Development Guidelines and Project Standards

[Code Familiarity]
1. Analyze the code thoroughly before making changes
2. Understand codebase structure, features, gaps, and goals before starting
3. Analyze and review the full codebase before working
4. Check existing files and code before adding new ones

[Dependencies]
5. Use existing dependencies if possible
6. Do not add new dependencies unless absolutely necessary

[DatabaseAndDataFlow]
7. Use Dapper to access the databases
8. Try not to change data models
9. Only add new model files if they don’t already exist
10. Keep models compatible with DB/XML/IFS formats

[CodingPrinciples]
11. Avoid breaking existing functionality
12. Focus on scoped improvements only
13. Apply Single Responsibility Principle
14. Keep code clean and maintainable
15. Remove unused legacy code
16. Align new classes with the structure and style of existing ones
17. Keep using statements clean and up to date

[Versioning]
18. Do not change language version
19. IFS API DLLs must use .NET Framework 4.6.1

[Documentation]
20. Use clear, relevant XML documentation comments
21. Remove outdated or irrelevant comments
22. Maintain README.md with current app, codebase, settings, and UI details
23. Do not fabricate details—verify before documenting
24. Exclude Collaboration and License sections from README
25. Include Contents section in README
26. Document codebase as tree structure with descriptions
27. Update order:
    - XML code comments
    - TODO.md
    - UI updates
    - README.md
28. Ensure project file has no legacy or missing files before documentation

[TODOManagement]
29. Maintain TODO.md for tracking tasks
30. Mark completed tasks as done—do not delete them
31. Keep TODO file current and organized

[Misc]
32. Keep ConsoleUI in sync with changes
33. XML examples:
    - Input: Templates/Invoices/
    - Output: Templates/Output/
34. IFS API usage example in Templates/IfsApiTemplate.cs
35. Remember what we are trying to achieve: a well organized, clean and easy to use app that moves data from xml file to IFS API
