agents:
  enabled_agents:
    - "code_planner"
    - "code_editor"
    - "git_agent"
    - "web_data"
    - "web_search"      # NEW
    - "database"        # NEW
```

### Customizing Model Assignments

```yaml
agents:
  model_assignments:
    web_search:
      primary: "gemma3:27b"
      fallback: "mistral-nemo:12b"
      temperature: 0.5
```
