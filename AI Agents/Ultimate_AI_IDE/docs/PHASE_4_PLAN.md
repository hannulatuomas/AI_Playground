## Task Breakdown

### 4.1 Context Management Module (4-5 days)

**Files to Create**:
- `src/modules/context_manager/__init__.py`
- `src/modules/context_manager/manager.py`
- `src/modules/context_manager/summarizer.py`
- `src/modules/context_manager/embedder.py`
- `src/modules/context_manager/retriever.py`
- `src/modules/context_manager/window_manager.py`
- `tests/test_context_manager.py`

**The Problem**:
- AI models have limited context windows (4k-32k tokens)
- Large codebases exceed this limit
- Need intelligent context selection

**Features**:

1. **Code Summarization**
   ```python
   summarize_file(file: str) -> Summary
   - Extract key information:
     * Classes and their purposes
     * Function signatures
     * Dependencies and imports
     * Data structures
   - Store in database
   ```

2. **Embedding Generation**
   ```python
   generate_embeddings(code: str) -> Vector
   - Use sentence transformers
   - Create dense vectors
   - Store in FAISS index
   ```

3. **Context Retrieval**
   ```python
   get_relevant_context(query: str, max_tokens: int) -> Context
   - Search by semantic similarity
   - Rank by relevance
   - Fit within token limit
   ```

4. **Context Window Management**
   ```python
   manage_window(history: List[Message], max_tokens: int) -> List[Message]
   - Keep recent messages
   - Preserve important context
   - Summarize older messages
   ```

5. **Codebase Indexing**
   ```python
   index_codebase(project: Project) -> Index
   - Scan all files
   - Generate summaries
   - Create embeddings
   - Build search index
   ```

**Architecture**:
```
Code → Summarizer → Summary + Full Code
            ↓
       Embedder → Vector
            ↓
       FAISS Index
            ↓
    Query → Retriever → Relevant Context
```

**AI Prompts**:
```
Summarize this code file for quick reference:

{file_content}

Extract:
1. File purpose
2. Classes with brief descriptions
3. Key functions with signatures
4. Important data structures
5. External dependencies
6. Notable patterns or algorithms

Keep summary concise (<500 words) but informative.
Language: {language}
```

**Performance Considerations**:
- Lazy loading (index on-demand)
- Incremental updates (re-index changed files only)
- Caching (store frequent queries)
- Async operations (don't block)

---

### 4.2 Rule Management Module (2-3 days)

**Files to Create**:
- `src/modules/rule_manager/__init__.py`
- `src/modules/rule_manager/manager.py`
- `src/modules/rule_manager/parser.py`
- `src/modules/rule_manager/validator.py`

- `tests/test_rule_manager.py`

**Features**:

1. **Rule Storage**
   ```python
   add_rule(scope: Scope, category: str, rule: str, priority: int) -> Rule
   get_rules(scope: Scope = None, category: str = None) -> List[Rule]
   update_rule(rule_id: int, updates: Dict) -> bool
   delete_rule(rule_id: int) -> bool
   ```

2. **Rule Categories**:
   - **Coding Style**: Naming conventions, formatting
   - **Architecture**: File organization, module structure
   - **Best Practices**: Language-specific patterns
   - **Quality**: Code quality thresholds
   - **Testing**: Test coverage, test patterns
   - **Documentation**: Doc requirements
   - **Security**: Security practices

3. **Rule Injection**
   ```python
   inject_rules(prompt: str, project: Project) -> str
   - Retrieve applicable rules
   - Format rules
   - Append to prompt
   ```

4. **Rule Validation**
   ```python
   validate_code(code: str, rules: List[Rule]) -> ValidationResult
   - Check code against rules
   - Report violations
   - Suggest fixes
   ```

**Default Rules**:
```python
DEFAULT_RULES = {
    "python": {
        "style": [
            "Follow PEP 8 style guide",
            "Use type hints for function signatures",
            "Maximum line length: 100 characters",
            "Use f-strings for string formatting"
        ],
        "structure": [
            "Keep functions under 50 lines",
            "Keep files under 500 lines",
            "One class per file (except nested classes)",
            "Organize imports: standard, third-party, local"
        ],
        "quality": [
            "Add docstrings to all public functions/classes",
            "Handle errors explicitly (no bare except)",
            "Use context managers for resources",
            "Avoid global variables"
        ]
    },
    "javascript": {
        "style": [
            "Use const/let, never var",
            "Use === instead of ==",
            "Use arrow functions for callbacks",
            "Use async/await instead of promises chains"
        ]
    }
}
```

**Rule Precedence**:
1. Project-specific rules (highest priority)
2. Language-specific rules
3. Framework-specific rules
4. Global rules (lowest priority)

**AI Integration**:
```
Every AI prompt gets:

"Follow these coding rules strictly:
{formatted_rules}

If a rule conflicts with the task, explain why and seek clarification."
```

   decompose_task(description: str) -> List[SubTask]
   - Break into atomic tasks
   - Order by dependencies
   - Assign priorities
   - Estimate completion time
   ```

3. **Task Planning**
   ```python
   create_plan(task: Task) -> ExecutionPlan
   - Order sub-tasks
   - Allocate resources
   - Set checkpoints
   - Define success criteria
   ```

4. **Task Execution**
   ```python
   execute_plan(plan: ExecutionPlan) -> ExecutionResult

   - Handle failures
   - Adjust plan dynamically
   ```

5. **Progress Tracking**
   ```python
   track_progress(task: Task) -> Progress
   - Current sub-task
   - Completed sub-tasks
   - Remaining work
   - Estimated completion
   ```

**Example Decomposition**:

Input: "Create user authentication system"

Output:
```python
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "description": "Create User model with fields: username, email, password_hash",
        "dependencies": [],
        "estimated_time": "5 min"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "description": "Implement password hashing utility using bcrypt",
        "dependencies": [],
        "estimated_time": "5 min"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "description": "Create registration endpoint",
        "dependencies": [1, 2],
        "estimated_time": "10 min"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "description": "Create login endpoint with JWT token generation",
        "dependencies": [1, 2],
        "estimated_time": "10 min"
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "description": "Create authentication middleware",
        "dependencies": [4],
        "estimated_time": "8 min"
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "description": "Generate tests for authentication flow",
        "dependencies": [3, 4, 5],
        "estimated_time": "15 min"
    }
]
```

**AI Prompts**:
```
Break down this large feature into small, manageable sub-tasks:

Feature: {description}
Project context: {context}
Language: {language}
Framework: {framework}

Requirements:
1. Each sub-task should take < 15 minutes
2. Sub-tasks should be atomic (one clear objective)
3. Include dependencies between tasks
4. Order tasks logically
5. Include testing tasks

Output as JSON array with format:
{
  "id": int,
  "description": str,
  "dependencies": [list of task ids],
  "estimated_time": str
}
```

**Files to Create**:
- `src/modules/self_improver/__init__.py`
- `src/modules/self_improver/logger.py`
- `src/modules/self_improver/analyzer.py`
- `src/modules/self_improver/learner.py`
- `src/modules/self_improver/adapter.py`
- `tests/test_self_improver.py`

**The Goal**: Learn from mistakes and improve over time

**Features**:

1. **Event Logging**
   ```python
   log_event(
       action: str,
       success: bool,
       error: str = None,
       feedback: str = None,
       context: Dict = None
   ) -> LogEntry
   ```

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   ```python
   analyze_errors() -> List[ErrorPattern]
   - Identify recurring errors
   - Find common causes
   - Detect anti-patterns
   ```

3. **Learning**
   ```python
   learn_from_feedback(logs: List[LogEntry]) -> Insights
   - What works well?
   - What fails often?
   - Why do failures occur?
   - How to prevent them?
   ```

4. **Adaptation**
   ```python
   adapt_behavior(insights: Insights) -> List[Adaptation]
   - Update prompts
   - Adjust parameters
   - Modify strategies
   - Add safeguards
   ```

5. **Improvement Suggestions**
   ```python
   suggest_improvements() -> List[Suggestion]
   - Better prompts
   - New rules

{
    "timestamp": datetime,
    "module": str,
    "action": str,
    "input": dict,
    "output": dict,
    "success": bool,
    "error": str,
    "error_type": str,
    "context": dict,
    "feedback": str
}
```

**Analysis Examples**:

1. **Recurring Error**:
   ```
   Pattern: "Import error: No module named 'X'"
   Frequency: 15 times in last week
   Cause: AI forgets to check existing imports
   Solution: Add import checking step before code generation
   ```

2. **Success Pattern**:
   ```
   Pattern: "Tests pass on first try"
   Frequency: 80% when context includes similar code
   Insight: Context retrieval is effective
   Action: Improve context retrieval for edge cases
   ```

**AI Prompts**:
```
Analyze these error logs and suggest improvements:

{error_logs}

For each recurring error pattern:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Explain why it keeps happening
3. Suggest a concrete solution
4. Propose updated prompts/rules to prevent it

Focus on actionable improvements.
```

**Self-Improvement Cycle**:
```
Execute → Log → Analyze → Learn → Adapt → Repeat
```
