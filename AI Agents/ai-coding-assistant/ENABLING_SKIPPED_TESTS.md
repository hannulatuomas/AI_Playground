# How to Enable the Skipped test_similarity Test

## 📋 Current Status

**Test**: `test_similarity` in Phase 9.2  
**Status**: ⏭️ SKIPPED  
**Reason**: Requires transformers and torch (large dependencies)

---

## 🎯 Quick Solution

Run this command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
install_full_deps.bat
```

This will install:
- `transformers` (~400MB)
- `torch` (~1.5GB)

**Total download**: ~2GB  
**Time**: 5-10 minutes

---

## 📦 What Gets Installed

### transformers>=4.30.0
- Used for CodeBERT embeddings
- Enables code similarity computation
- Required for test_similarity test

### torch>=2.0.0
- Required by transformers
- CPU version (for compatibility)
- Provides neural network backend

---

## ✅ After Installation

The test will no longer be skipped:

**Before:**
```
Ran 10 tests in 24.009s
OK (skipped=1)
```

**After:**
```
Ran 10 tests in 30.000s
OK
```

---

## 🔧 Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Install torch first (CPU version)
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Then install transformers
pip install transformers>=4.30.0
```

Or use the requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-full.txt
```

## 💡 Do I Need This?

**No, you don't NEED it for Phase 11.1!**

The skipped test is for **Phase 9.2 advanced features**. Phase 11.1 (Automated Test Generation) works perfectly without it.

### Current Test Results (Without Full Deps)
```
Total Test Suites: 7
Passed: 7
Failed: 0
Skipped: 1 (test_similarity - optional)

Result: ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

### If You Install Full Deps
```
Total Test Suites: 7
Passed: 7  
Failed: 0
Skipped: 0

Result: ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

---

## 🤔 Should I Install It?

### ✅ Install If:
- You want 100% test coverage (no skips)
- You want to use CodeBERT embeddings
- You want code similarity features
- You have good internet connection
- You have 2GB+ free disk space

### ⏭️ Skip If:
- You're on limited bandwidth
- You're on limited disk space
- You just want Phase 11.1 to work
- You're okay with 1 skipped test

## 📊 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Without Full Deps | With Full Deps |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Phase 11.1 | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Basic RAG | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Phase 9.1 | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Phase 9.2 | ⚠️ Fallback | ✅ Full CodeBERT |
| Phase 9.3 | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ Advanced |
| test_similarity | ⏭️ Skipped | ✅ Runs |

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Phase 11.1 completion**: You don't need to install full deps. The skipped test is optional.

**For 100% feature coverage**: Run `install_full_deps.bat`

---

**Current Status**: ✅ Phase 11.1 is complete and production-ready even with the skipped test!

The test_similarity test is for Phase 9.2 advanced CodeBERT features, which are optional enhancements, not core requirements.
