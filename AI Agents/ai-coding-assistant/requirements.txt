# AI Coding Assistant - Requirements
# Python 3.12+ compatible versions
# Last Updated: October 17, 2025 (Post-Phase 9 integration)

# ================================================
# TESTING DEPENDENCIES (Optional but recommended)
# ================================================
# Required for running test suites
pytest>=7.4.0

# ================================================
# CORE DEPENDENCIES (Required for basic features)
# ================================================

# Colored terminal output (CLI)
colorama>=0.4.6

# Regex support (enhanced pattern matching)
regex>=2023.10.3

# ================================================
# PHASE 8 & 9: RAG Dependencies (Semantic Search)
# ================================================
# These enable advanced semantic code search
# All features work without these, but RAG will be disabled

# Vector embeddings for semantic search
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2

# Vector database for efficient similarity search
chromadb>=0.4.18

# NumPy for numerical operations
numpy>=1.26.0

# System monitoring and memory management
psutil>=5.9.0

# ================================================
# PHASE 9: Advanced RAG Features (Optional)
# ================================================
# These enhance RAG with additional capabilities
# Install for best performance (but not required)

# Transformers library for CodeBERT and advanced models
# Required for Phase 9.2 (Code Embeddings) and Phase 9.3 (Advanced reranking)
# transformers>=4.30.0
# torch>=2.0.0  # Required by transformers

# Note: Uncomment above lines to enable:
# - Phase 9.2: CodeBERT embeddings (code-specific semantic search)
# - Phase 9.3: Better cross-encoder models for reranking

# ================================================
# STANDARD LIBRARY (No installation needed)
# ================================================
# The following are built into Python:
# - sqlite3 (database)
# - subprocess (process management)
# - json (JSON handling)
# - pathlib (path operations)
# - argparse (CLI arguments)
# - tkinter (GUI - usually included)
# - threading (concurrency)
# - pickle (serialization)
# - hashlib (hashing)
# - collections (data structures)
# - re (regex - basic)
# - os, sys (system operations)

# ================================================
# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
# ================================================

# Basic installation (core features only):
#   pip install colorama regex
#   (RAG features will be disabled)

# Standard installation (with RAG):
#   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Full installation (all Phase 9 features):
#   1. Install standard: pip install -r requirements.txt
#   2. Uncomment transformers+torch above
#   3. Install: pip install transformers torch
#   (Enables CodeBERT and advanced reranking)

# Minimal installation (smallest footprint):
#   pip install colorama
#   (Only colored output, no RAG)

# ================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ================================================

# If installation fails:
#   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
#   pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Python 3.12+ compatibility issues:
#   pip install --upgrade sentence-transformers chromadb numpy

# For Windows users:
#   Some packages may require Visual C++ Build Tools
#   Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

# For low-memory systems:
#   Install without transformers/torch
#   Phase 9.1 and 9.3 will work fine
#   Phase 9.2 (CodeBERT) will use fallback

# ================================================
# FEATURE AVAILABILITY
# ================================================

# With this file (without transformers):
#   ✓ Core features (code generation, debugging)
#   ✓ Basic RAG (Phase 8)
#   ✓ Phase 9.1: Query expansion, feedback, graph
#   ✓ Phase 9.3: Cross-encoder (basic), hybrid search, query understanding
#   ⚠ Phase 9.2: CodeBERT (fallback mode)

# With transformers + torch:
#   ✓ All features at 100%
#   ✓ Phase 9.2: Full CodeBERT embeddings
#   ✓ Phase 9.3: Advanced cross-encoder models

# ================================================
# VERSION COMPATIBILITY
# ================================================

# Python: 3.12.0 or higher (tested on 3.12.10)
# OS: Windows, Linux, macOS (cross-platform)
# RAM: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
# Disk: 2GB for models and dependencies

# ================================================
# SECURITY & PRIVACY
# ================================================
