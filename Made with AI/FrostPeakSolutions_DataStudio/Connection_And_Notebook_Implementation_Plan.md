# Implementation Plan: Connection Management & Notebook Cell UI

---

## 1. Centralize Validation and Parsing Logic

**Goal:**  
Move all connection validation and parsing logic from React components to a centralized TypeScript utility module for reusability, maintainability, and testability.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- Centralized utility module: `frontend/src/utils/connectionValidation.ts` created and documented.
- All functions (`validateForm`, `validateField`, `parseConnStr`) moved, extended for all DB types, and documented with JSDoc.
- `ConnectionPanel.tsx` refactored to use only the centralized logic; no legacy or duplicate validation remains.
- Module is ready for future unit testing.

---

## 2. Add/Improve Tooltips and Help Text

**Goal:**  
Provide clear, user-friendly tooltips and help text for all fields, especially advanced/optional ones.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- **ConnectionPanel:**
  - All fields have info icons and accessible tooltips using the `FieldTooltip` component.
  - Help text is concise and covers all fields, including advanced/optional.
  - Tooltips are accessible (keyboard/screen reader) and require no new dependencies.
- **Notebook Cell UI:**
  - All notebook cell fields have tooltips, help text, sample queries, and documentation links. Placeholders and accessibility for all inputs are ensured.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue to audit notebook cell UI as new cell types or features are added.
- Maintain accessibility and modularity as the codebase evolves.

## 3. Notebook Cell UI Improvements

### A. Query Validation

**Goal:**  
Prevent invalid queries from being sent and provide immediate feedback.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- MongoDB JSON and Neo4j Cypher validation are implemented in notebook cells.
- Inline error display and disabling of the Run button for invalid queries are present.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue to improve validation logic as new database types or features are added.

### B. User Guidance and Tooltips

**Goal:**  
Help users write correct queries and understand the UI.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- Tooltips, sample queries, documentation links, and collapsible help sections are present in notebook cell UI.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue to improve user guidance as new cell types or features are added.

### C. Unified and Modularized Result/Loading/Error Display

**Goal:**  
Ensure all notebook cell types have a consistent, accessible UX for displaying results, loading states, and errors.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- Unified result/loading/error display component is used across all cell types.

**Next Steps:**
- Refactor as needed to maintain consistency and accessibility with new features.

### D. Accessibility Improvements

**Goal:**  
Make all controls accessible via ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete**
- ARIA labels and keyboard navigation are implemented for all notebook cell controls.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue to audit and test for accessibility as the UI evolves.

## General Best Practices

- Remove any legacy or duplicate code as you refactor.
- Ensure all schema/query endpoints always receive full connection details from frontend (never just uid).
- Table dropdown in Schema Cell is always sorted alphabetically for better UX.
- Keep all logic modular, reusable, and well-documented.
- Update documentation (README, inline docs, FeatureStatus.md, Next Steps.md) after each major change.
- Do not introduce new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer existing solutions.
- Ensure all UI changes are responsive and accessible.
- Focus next on extensibility, plugin/registry, and advanced analytics (see [README.md](./README.md) and [FeatureStatus.md](./FeatureStatus.md)).
