## 1. Theme Toggle (Light/Dark Mode)
- [x] **Define theme variables:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - All colors, backgrounds, borders, etc. are now managed via CSS variables in theme.css for both light and dark modes.
- [x] **Add ThemeContext:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - ThemeContext provides theme state and a toggle function app-wide. ThemeProvider is integrated at app root.
- [x] **Persist user preference:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - User's theme selection is stored in localStorage and restored on load.
- [x] **Refactor styles:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - All key CSS files refactored to use theme variables. No hardcoded color values remain in main styles.
- [x] **Add toggle UI:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - Accessible theme toggle button (ðŸŒž/ðŸŒ™) added to sidebar, styled with CSS variables.
- [x] **Ensure accessibility:** _(2025-05-09, partial)_
    - All color variables for both themes provide strong contrast by design (WCAG AA/AAA for text and status colors). Theme toggle is implemented in Sidebar and is keyboard accessible. **Manual audit with browser tools and screen readers recommended for final verification.**
- [x] **Document theme support:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - Theme support, toggle instructions, persistence, and accessibility are now documented in the README under the new 'Theme Support' section. User docs should reference this as well.

    - `Sidebar.tsx` (navigation, file explorer)
    - `NotebookEditor.tsx` (main notebook area)
    - `FilePanel.tsx`, `ResultsPanel.tsx`, `Modal` components
- **Initial findings:**
    - Main layout uses flexbox for horizontal arrangement.
    - Sidebar and main panels do not yet collapse or hide on small screens.
    - No hamburger menu or mobile-specific controls yet.
    - Most panels/components use fixed or min widths; breakpoints/media queries not present.
    - Modals and overlays need touch optimization and responsive sizing.

    - Added breakpoints and responsive CSS for all main panels and notebook editor; layout stacks vertically and buttons are touch-friendly on small screens.
    - Implemented collapsible/hamburger Sidebar for small screens.
    - Increased touch target sizes and spacing for controls.
    - Refactored modals/dialogs for mobile usability (responsive width, larger close buttons, touch-friendly action buttons).
    - Fixed Sidebar JSX fragment/closing tag error (component now renders without lint errors).
    - Manual testing recommended for all flows (file upload, query, schema editing, notebook navigation) on mobile devices/emulators.
    - Documented mobile support and UI/UX improvements in user docs and README.

- [x] **Design ResizablePanel component:** _(2025-05-09)_

- [x] **Add visual cues:** _(2025-05-09)_
    - Grab handles with visual dots added for usability. Keyboard resizing is planned (not yet implemented).
- [x] **Test responsiveness:** _(2025-05-09)_

## 12. Best Practices
- No hardcoded values or magic numbers; use theme/context/config everywhere.
- All file and schema logic is modular, reusable, and context-driven.
- Avoid new dependencies unless absolutely necessary; prefer existing ones.
- Clean up legacy/duplicate styles and code immediately when changing or adding features.
- Document all new features, architectural changes, and update screenshots in README as needed.
- Maintain testability, accessibility, and extensibility throughout.
- [x] **Bulk file delete:** _(2025-06-XX)_
    - Bulk file selection and deletion with confirmation dialog is implemented. User confirmation is required for destructive actions. Undo handled by UI state. All logic uses unique file IDs.

> _Follow this checklist strictly to ensure a modern, robust, and accessible UI/UX for all users._
