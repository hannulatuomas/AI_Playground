# Connection Management & Notebook Cell UI: Feature Status (2025-05-09)

## Connection Management

### 1. Field-level validation
- **Required fields (host, port, user, password, database, URI as appropriate):**
  - ✅ Implemented. The `validateForm` function (now in `connectionValidation.ts`) checks for required fields based on the selected database type. Errors are shown inline next to the relevant fields.
- **Format checks for URIs and ports:**
  - ✅ Implemented. Format checks for connection strings (e.g., must start with `mongodb://` for MongoDB, `neo4j://` for Neo4j, etc.). Ports are required to be numbers.
- **Display inline error messages next to fields:**
  - ✅ Implemented. Error messages are displayed directly below each field using `{fieldErrors.fieldName && <span>...</span>}`.

### 2. Tooltips/help text
- **For advanced/optional fields (replicaSet, neo4jDatabase, etc.):**
  - ✅ **Complete.** All fields in ConnectionPanel and notebook cell UI have info icons and accessible tooltips via the `FieldTooltip` component. Help text covers all fields.
- **Briefly explain each field’s purpose:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** All field purposes are explained via tooltips or placeholders in both ConnectionPanel and notebook cell UI.

### 3. Centralize validation and parsing logic
- **Move to a utility module to avoid duplication and ensure consistency:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** All validation and parsing logic is now in `frontend/src/utils/connectionValidation.ts` and used by `ConnectionPanel.tsx`.

## Notebook Cell UI

### 1. Add query validation
- **MongoDB: Validate JSON syntax before sending:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** MongoDB query input is validated for JSON syntax before sending.
- **Neo4j: Basic Cypher syntax check:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** Cypher query input is validated before sending.
- **Display errors inline, prevent sending invalid queries:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** Inline error display and disabling of Run button for invalid queries.

### 2. Add user guidance/tooltips
- **Show sample queries and docs links:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** Sample queries, docs links, and systematic tooltips/collapsible help are present in notebook cell UI.
- **Use tooltips or collapsible help sections:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** Collapsible help and consistent tooltips are implemented in notebook cells.

### 3. Unify and modularize result/loading/error display
- **Extract shared logic into a reusable component/hook:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** Unified result/loading/error display component is used across cell types.
- **Ensure all cell types have consistent UX and accessibility:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** Consistency and accessibility are ensured across cell types.

### 4. Accessibility
- **Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support for all controls:**
  - ✅ **Complete.** ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support are implemented in all notebook cell controls.

**Next Steps Recommended:**
- Continue to audit and improve documentation and user-facing guides as features evolve.
- Continue to audit for robust connection handling and frontend/backend consistency.
- Maintain accessibility and modularity as new features and cell types are added.
- See [README.md](./README.md) and [FeatureStatus.md](./FeatureStatus.md) for architecture and implementation status.
