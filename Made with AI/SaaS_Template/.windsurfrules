5. Keep 3rd-party packages to minimum and try not to use vulnerable or deprecated packages to future-proof the project
6. App should have Google login, Stripe integration and 3 tiers of subscription (free, basic and pro)
7. Make sure you are fully familiar with the codebaseâ€™s structure, current features, outstanding gaps, missing features and the main goals of the project before starting to work on it
8. Before starting to work on the project, thoroughly analyze and become fully familiar with the codebase
9. Clear all legacy code and duplicate code, remove unnecessary comments, and ensure the code is clean and maintainable
10. Always follow the best practices of security, performance, and accessibility
11. Check thoroughly what we have before adding new code

14. When updating code, make sure to update documentation in all relevant places

17. UI should have responsive, clean and minimalistic design, with scaling based on screen size
18. I want you to have always up to date memories of the "project status" (what is done), features, codebase structure and next steps & gaps (what needs to be done)
19. You can find the project status in these files: @CheckList.md @README.md @Saas-FolderStructure.txt @SummaryTable.md
