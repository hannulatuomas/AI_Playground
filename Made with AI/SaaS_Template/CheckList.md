# SaaS Template Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Codebase is free of legacy, dummy, or unused code as of latest audit

## 1. Authentication & Security
- [ ] In-memory user store is a template placeholder and must be replaced with a persistent DB in production
- [x] Email/password signup, login, and logout fully tested
- [x] Social login (Google) works end-to-end
- [x] Email verification flow implemented and enforced (minimal, via VerifyEmail page/flow only)
- [x] Password reset (request, token, reset form) works
- [x] Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- [x] JWT or session management with secure cookies
- [x] Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- [x] CSRF, XSS, and CORS protections in place
- [ ] User roles/permissions enforced (user, etc.)

## 2. Billing & Subscription
- [x] Stripe integration: checkout, webhooks, plan management
- [ ] Subscription status checked before allowing premium features
- [ ] Graceful handling of failed payments and cancellations
- [ ] Invoice history and downloadable invoices for users


## 3. User Management
- [x] User profile page (edit/change password present, delete account present)

## 4. Notifications & Communication
- [ ] Email notifications (welcome, verification, billing, password reset)
- [ ] In-app notifications (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Email provider set up (MailerSend, SendGrid, etc.)

## 5. API & Integrations
- [ ] REST/GraphQL API documented and tested
- [ ] API authentication and rate limiting
- [ ] Webhook endpoints for Stripe and other integrations (missing/incomplete)
- [ ] API key management (missing)

## 6. Frontend
- [x] Responsive design (all forms, cards, and main flows fully responsive and visually consistent)
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y) checks passed
- [ ] Error boundaries and advanced error handling (still missing; most forms now have robust validation and user-friendly error messages)
- [x] Loading and empty states for all async content (all user-facing pages/components covered)
- [x] Environment variables for API endpoints, Stripe keys, etc.

## 7. General & Legal
- [x] Verification email resend endpoint uses both per-IP and per-email (user/email) rate limiting (3/hour/IP and 3/hour/email) for robust, production-grade protection. This is implemented in-memory for the template and can be upgraded to Redis or another shared store for distributed deployments.
- [ ] Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages
- [ ] Cookie consent (if applicable)
- [ ] GDPR compliance (if serving EU users)
- [ ] Contact/support page or link

## 8. DevOps & Monitoring
- [ ] Environment variables managed via .env files and secrets

## 9. Missing/Planned Features
- [ ] Shared ErrorAlert component for even more consistency in error handling
- [ ] Review edge cases for advanced flows (e.g., multi-step forms, modals)
- [ ] Logging for errors and important events (backend & frontend)
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- [ ] Automated backups for database
- [x] Health check endpoints for uptime monitoring

## 9. Testing & Quality
- [ ] Unit and integration tests for backend logic (missing)
- [ ] E2E tests for critical flows (auth, billing) (missing)
- [ ] Linting and formatting enforced (eslint, prettier)
- [ ] Type checking passes (TypeScript)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline set up (build, test, deploy)

## 10. Deployment
- [ ] Production build scripts for both client and server
- [ ] Secure HTTPS enabled in production
- [ ] CORS configured for production domains
- [ ] Static assets optimized (images, fonts)
- [ ] CDN and caching for static files
