# Essential Features for a Minimalistic SaaS Template

Here’s a clear breakdown tailored to your requirements for a minimalistic, robust SaaS template with only essential features (no team management, no extra external services beyond Stripe, MailerSend, and Google OAuth):

---

## 1. **Absolute Must-Haves (for a minimal, production-ready SaaS template)**

**Authentication & Security**
- Email/password authentication (with JWT, secure cookies)
- Google OAuth login
- Email verification flow
- Password reset (Forgot/Reset Password, secure endpoints, MailerSend integration)
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- CSRF, XSS, and CORS protections
- Rate limiting (especially on auth endpoints)
- Centralized error handling (backend & frontend)
- Minimal, accessible ErrorBoundary in React

**Billing & Subscription**
- Stripe integration: checkout, webhooks, plan management
- 3 subscription tiers (free, basic, pro)
- Profile page shows current tier, allows upgrade/downgrade

**User Management**
- User profile page (change password, delete account, see email)
- Logout functionality

**Frontend**
- Responsive, minimal, modern UI (React, Vite, TailwindCSS)
- Robust client-side validation and user-friendly error messages on all forms
- Accessible forms and error messages (a11y basics)
- Clean navigation (register, login, profile, subscription, etc.)

**Backend**
- Modular Express structure (routes, controllers, middleware, services)
- Input validation middleware (e.g., express-validator)
- Secure environment variable handling

**Documentation**
- Up-to-date README, checklist, folder structure, and summary table
- Clear setup instructions (env vars, Stripe/MailerSend/Google setup)
- Minimal, clean code with no dummy/unused code

---

## 2. **Strongly Recommended (but not strictly mandatory)**

- **Production deployment polish:**  
  - Add a simple CI/CD workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions for lint/build/test)
  - Add a basic monitoring/uptime check (even just a comment or doc suggestion)
  - Add a CDN/static asset caching hint (for frontend assets)
  - Add a script or doc note for regular database backups (if DB is used)

- **Testing:**  
  - Add a few example unit tests (Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend)
  - Add a simple integration test (e.g., register/login flow)
  - Add E2E test suggestion (e.g., Cypress, but not required in template)

- **Accessibility (a11y):**
  - Ensure all forms and buttons are keyboard accessible
  - Use proper aria-labels and roles on error messages and forms

- **API Documentation:**  
  - Add a basic OpenAPI/Swagger doc or at least a markdown API overview

- **Minimal Legal Pages:**  
  - Add stub/static pages for Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (even if just placeholders with a note to fill in)

- **Basic Invoice History:**  
  - (Optional) Add a placeholder for invoice history (can be a stub or commented as “add if needed”)

---

## 3. **Not Needed for Minimal Template (skip for your use case)**
- Team management/multi-user features
- In-app notifications
- Advanced analytics/monitoring integrations
- API key management for third-party integrations
- Any extra external services (beyond Stripe, MailerSend, Google OAuth)
- Multi-tenant logic
- Extensive admin dashboards
- Anything not needed by most SaaS MVPs

**What are the things still need to be done before this if a good minimalistic SaaS template? And what are the things you succest but are not mandatory? (I'm not planning to add team management or other externl services than stripe, mailsend and google oauth in this template, because I vant this to be minimalistic and have only what is absolute must and nothing some project don't need)**
