# Codebase Audit (April 2025)

## What You Have (Based on Evidence)
- **Authentication:** Email/password, Google OAuth, JWT, secure cookies, email verification, password reset (MailerSend).
- **Security:** Rate limiting, CSRF/XSS/CORS protections, secure password hashing, centralized error handling.
- **Billing:** Stripe integration, 3 tiers, profile tier management.
- **User Management:** Profile page (change password, delete account, logout), email read-only.
- **Frontend:** Modern, responsive UI (React/Vite/Tailwind), robust validation, accessible error messages, minimal navigation.
- **Backend:** Modular Express structure, validation middleware, secure env vars.
- **Docs:** README, checklist, summary table, folder structure all up-to-date and accurate.
- **No unnecessary code or dummy data.**

## What’s Missing or Needs Attention
### Essentials
- **Loading/empty states:** Ensure all async flows (profile, subscription, auth, etc.) handle loading/empty/error states robustly and accessibly.
- **Webhook endpoints:** Stripe webhooks are present. If you use MailerSend webhooks (for e.g., bounce/complaint handling), document or stub as needed.
- **Static asset optimization:** Consider adding a note in docs about using Vite’s asset optimization and/or CDN for production.
- **Type checking & linting:** Ensure type-check and lint scripts are in `package.json` and run in CI or pre-commit.
- **API key management:** Ensure all secrets (Stripe, MailerSend, Google) are handled via env vars and never exposed client-side.

### Strongly Recommended
- **CI/CD:** Add a simple GitHub Actions/other config for lint/build/test.
- **Monitoring/Uptime:** Add a doc note or suggest a simple solution (e.g., UptimeRobot, status page).
- **Testing:** Add at least one backend and one frontend test as an example.
- **API Documentation:** Add a simple markdown file or Swagger spec.
- **Legal Pages:** Add `/terms` and `/privacy` routes/pages, even if just placeholders.
- **Invoice History:** If Stripe invoices are relevant, provide a stub or comment in code/docs.
