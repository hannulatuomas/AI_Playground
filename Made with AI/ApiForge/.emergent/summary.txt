The trajectory outlines the AI engineer's comprehensive development of APIForge. Initially, the AI addressed a critical  in  and successfully built the frontend. Following this, enterprise features (Microsoft Integration, Workflows, GDPR, Monitoring) were integrated into the  and  with mock backend functionality. A significant portion of the conversation focused on restoring and enhancing collection/request management (CRUD, import/export) and ensuring mobile responsiveness. This involved several attempts to implement a functional mobile sidebar using  and  components, and repeatedly adding/verifying import/export buttons. The persistent challenge has been the visual rendering of the mobile sidebar and its controls, despite the code often indicating their presence. The last interaction shows the user insisting that Export Collections and individual Export buttons are still missing from the mobile view, leading the AI to re-verify their implementation.

The user requires APIForge, an API management and debugging tool supporting REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSockets. It needs automatic endpoint import from OpenAPI, WSDL, RAML, and GraphQL schemas, an intuitive low-code UI with drag-and-drop workflow creation, versioning, environment variables, robust debugging, real-time monitoring, collaboration, and enterprise-grade security (GDPR). The application must be performant, responsive, modular, and extendable.

Key development phases completed by the previous engineer include:
1.  **MVP:** Core REST API testing, collection management, spec import, basic UI, debugging panel, JWT authentication, and a clean light/dark UI.
2.  **Multi-protocol and Import:** Extended support for REST/SOAP/GraphQL/gRPC/WebSockets and basic import (OpenAPI, WSDL, RAML).
3.  **Enterprise Features:** Integration of Microsoft Stack, non-AI workflows, a Low-Code Visual Designer, a Full Visibility Dashboard, and EU GDPR Compliance features.
4. **Collection and Request Management**: CRUD operations for collections and requests, including import/export.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication:** JWT for user sessions.
-   **UI Frameworks:** Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI.
-   **API Protocols:** REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets.
-   **API Specification Imports/Exports:** OpenAPI, WSDL, RAML, Postman, Insomnia, GraphQL schemas.
-   **Data Handling:** Pydantic for validation, UUIDs for MongoDB IDs.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: This is the core FastAPI application. It now includes user authentication, API collection management, multi-protocol request handling (REST, SOAP, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket), and comprehensive API import/export functionality with parsing for OpenAPI, WSDL, RAML, GraphQL schemas. Enterprise features initially in  have been integrated into  with mock implementations for Microsoft integrations.
-   ****: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and MongoDB schemas.
-   ****: This file was initially created for enterprise features but its contents were later merged into  and the file itself is likely no longer actively used.
-   ****: The main React component, heavily modified. It handles routing, state management, theme switching, UI rendering for dashboard, request builder, response viewer, and integrates all enterprise-specific components, multi-protocol support, and import/export dialogs. Significant changes focused on fixing a , adding view management for enterprise features, implementing collection/request CRUD with dialogs, and repeatedly attempting to fix mobile responsiveness of the sidebar and its controls.
-   ****: Global styles and Tailwind directives, modified for toast contrast and theme readability.
-   ** and **: React components for enterprise features, integrated into .
-   ****: A new component or an existing one heavily modified to handle import of OpenAPI, WSDL, RAML, GraphQL, Postman, and Insomnia specifications.
-   ****: A newly added component for exporting collections in multiple formats (APIForge Native, OpenAPI, Postman, Insomnia, WSDL, RAML, GraphQL).

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve the persistent issue of the mobile sidebar (Sheet component) not visually opening, despite internal state changes and DOM elements being present.
-   Ensure all collection/request management buttons (especially Import/Export) are correctly visible and functional within the mobile sidebar. The user is currently reporting the Export Collections button and individual Export buttons are still missing from the mobile view.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on resolving mobile responsiveness issues, specifically ensuring full parity between desktop and mobile UI for collection/request management and enterprise features. After several iterations of modifying the mobile sidebar (switching between , , and custom approaches), the current state involves using the  component again.

The immediate focus was to re-implement and verify the presence of Export Collections and individual Export buttons within the mobile sidebar, as the user reported they were still missing. The AI believes these buttons are implemented in the code after a series of edits, including adding  to the collections header and individual collection export buttons. However, the user is still reporting that the Export Collections button (in the collections header, next to Import and Create) is not visible in mobile mode. The AI's last action was to verify this specific claim.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the visibility of the Export Collections button in the mobile collections header.
