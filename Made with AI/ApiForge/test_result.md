# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Node Visual Design: Perfect 150px width, 80px min-height dimensions with gray circular input/output ports positioned on left/right sides. Port Hover Effects: Output ports turn green on hover (input port styling minor issue). Drag-to-Move: Nodes draggable with scale-105 effect and enhanced shadow during movement. Port-Based Connection System: Drag from output to input ports creates curved connection lines with arrow markers and dashed preview while dragging. Double-Click Editing: Opens node-specific configuration dialogs with Delete Node button. Enhanced UX Elements: Empty canvas shows helpful instructions, professional grid background, consistent styling, updated sidebar instructions. All 9 node types working with correct port counts. New/Save Workflow buttons functional. Minor: Modal overlay occasionally blocks connection deletion (UI interaction issue only). The redesigned workflow interface provides an excellent professional node editor experience with intuitive drag-to-connect and double-click editing system."

Extensively tested improved config dialog fix on both mobile (375px) and desktop (1920px) viewports. DESKTOP RESULTS: Configuration dialogs open smoothly via settings ⚙️ button without blinking, remain stable during mouse movement, proper form interactions. MOBILE RESULTS: Dialogs open successfully on 375px width without flickering, stable during interactions, settings buttons clearly visible and functional. CROSS-PLATFORM CONSISTENCY: Same number of settings buttons (2) found on both platforms, consistent behavior. ENHANCED INTERACTIONS: Settings buttons provide reliable node configuration access, no duplicate dialogs, rapid open/close cycles work properly.

DESKTOP TESTING (1920px): Successfully tested all cursor movement patterns - slow circular movements, fast erratic movements, boundary crossing, and element hovering. Dialog remained completely stable with NO blinking during all cursor movement scenarios. CANVAS INTERACTION ISOLATION: Verified all canvas interactions properly disabled when dialog open - background clicks blocked, node interactions blocked, connection creation disabled. PERFORMANCE TESTING: Extensive cursor movement (300+ rapid movements) showed no re-rendering issues, no console errors, dialog remained responsive. RAPID DIALOG TESTING: Multiple rapid open/close cycles with cursor movement worked flawlessly. EDGE CASE TESTING: Dialog stable near canvas edges, during dialog transitions, and with multiple rapid operations. The comprehensive fix completely eliminates cursor movement causing dialog blinking. MOBILE LIMITATION: Mobile testing limited due to navigation issues in test environment, but desktop testing confirms the fix works across all cursor movement scenarios as requested."
