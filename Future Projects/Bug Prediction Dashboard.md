You are an experienced senior developer and expert in AI.
I want to make an App using AI, so I need you to give me a comprehensive, detailed project plan for this. Make it AI-friendly. 
The App idea is this: "Bug Prediction Dashboard
Uses Mistral 7B to analyze git history + static analysis
Flags high-risk files before CI runs
Caught 3 critical bugs in prod code last sprint"

------------------------------------

# Bug Prediction Dashboard Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
The Bug Prediction Dashboard is an AI-driven application that proactively identifies potential bugs in software codebases by analyzing Git history and static code analysis results. Powered by the Mistral 7B model, it processes historical commit data, code churn metrics, and static analysis outputs to flag high-risk files or modules before they enter continuous integration (CI) pipelines. This preemptive approach helps prevent defects from reaching production, as demonstrated by catching 3 critical bugs in a recent sprint. The dashboard provides visual insights, risk scores, and actionable recommendations, integrating with tools like GitHub or GitLab for seamless developer workflows.

The project is designed to be AI-friendly, with a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of AI tools during development (e.g., using LLMs for code generation, prompt-based testing). Each phase includes AI-assisted steps to leverage models like Mistral for prototyping, data synthesis, and automation, enabling rapid iteration and scalability.

## 2. Objectives and Goals
### Primary Objectives:
- Analyze Git history (e.g., commit frequency, author patterns, churn rates) and static analysis (e.g., from tools like SonarQube or pylint) using Mistral 7B to predict bug-prone areas.
- Generate risk scores and flag high-risk files/modules before CI runs, integrating as a pre-commit hook or dashboard alert.
- Achieve real-world impact, such as detecting critical bugs early, targeting a similar outcome to catching 3 prod bugs per sprint.
- Provide an intuitive dashboard for visualizing predictions, trends, and historical bug data.

### Secondary Goals:
- Support multi-language codebases (initial focus on Python, Java, JavaScript).
- Ensure low-latency predictions for large repos (process in under 2 minutes).
- Make the system customizable for different risk thresholds and integration points.
- Promote AI explainability with feature importance and prediction rationales.

### Success Metrics:
- Accuracy: 80%+ precision in flagging buggy files (validated against historical bugs).
- Efficiency: Reduce CI failures by 30%+ in beta testing.
- Detection Rate: Catch at least 2-3 critical bugs per sprint in internal use.
- Usability: 90%+ developer adoption rate in target teams.
- Performance: Handle repos with 100k+ commits without excessive resource use.

## 3. Scope
### In-Scope Features:
- **Data Ingestion**: Fetch Git history via APIs; run static analyzers and feed results to AI.
- **AI Prediction Engine**: Mistral 7B for multi-modal analysis (text from commits, metrics from analysis).
- **Risk Flagging**: Pre-CI hooks to scan changes; output risk scores (0-100) with explanations.
- **Dashboard UI**: Web-based interface showing heatmaps, timelines, and file-level risks.
- **Integration**: Hooks for GitHub Actions, Jenkins; alerts via email/Slack.
- **Reporting**: Exportable reports on bug predictions and historical accuracy.

### Out-of-Scope (for MVP):
- Real-time monitoring during coding (focus on pre-CI).
- Support for non-Git VCS (e.g., SVN).
- Advanced ensemble models (stick to Mistral 7B).
- Mobile app version.

### Assumptions:
- Access to a sample Git repo with historical bug data for training/validation.
- Developers have basic CI/CD knowledge.
- Hardware supports Mistral inference (e.g., via Ollama on GPU).
- Open-source ethos for community contributions.

## 4. Technologies and Tools
### Core AI Stack:
- **LLM**: Mistral 7B (open-weight model; use for sequence classification on git/static data).
- **Inference**: Ollama or Hugging Face Transformers for local/low-latency serving.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Optional LoRA for domain adaptation on bug datasets.

### Development Tools:
- **Languages**: Python for backend/AI; JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend.
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI for API; React or Dash for dashboard UI.
- **Git Integration**: Libgit2 or PyGit2 for history analysis.
- **Static Analysis**: Integrate tools like pylint, ESLint, Checkstyle via subprocess calls.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for metrics; Scikit-learn for feature engineering.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing predictions and history.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization; Kubernetes for scaling.
- **Testing**: Pytest; custom ML eval scripts.

### AI-Friendly Enhancements:
- Use AI assistants (e.g., Mistral itself) for generating feature extraction code.
- Prompt templates: E.g., "Analyze this git commit diff: {diff}. Predict bug risk based on {static_results}."

## 5. High-Level Architecture
The app employs a pipeline-based architecture for data flow and predictions:

- **Input Layer**: Webhooks from Git (e.g., pre-push events) or manual triggers; fetch history and run static analysis.
- **Processing Layer**: Feature extraction (churn, complexity metrics); feed to Mistral 7B for risk prediction.
- **AI Core**: Model infers patterns from historical bugs; outputs scores and flags.
- **Output Layer**: Dashboard renders visualizations; integrations send alerts.
- **Storage Layer**: DB for logging predictions, enabling retraining.

                                                              |
                                                              v
                                                       [DB: Prediction History]
```

This setup is AI-friendly: Isolate AI module for easy swapping or prompting during dev.
