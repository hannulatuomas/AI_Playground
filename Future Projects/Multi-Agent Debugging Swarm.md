You are an experienced senior developer and expert in AI.
I want to make an App using AI, so I need you to give me a comprehensive, detailed project plan for this. Make it AI-friendly. 
The App idea is this: "Multi-Agent Debugging Swarm
3 specialized agents (root-cause, fix-gen, test-gen)
Built with LangGraph + local models
Resolved a gnarly race condition in 11 minutes (vs 3+ hours manually)"

# Multi-Agent Debugging Swarm Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
The Multi-Agent Debugging Swarm is an AI-powered application that automates software debugging through a collaborative swarm of three specialized agents: a root-cause analyzer, a fix generator, and a test generator. Built using LangGraph for orchestrating multi-agent workflows and local LLM models for inference, the app processes bug reports, code snippets, or error logs to identify issues, propose fixes, and validate them with automated tests. This system dramatically accelerates debugging, as evidenced by resolving a complex race condition in just 11 minutes compared to over 3 hours manually. It integrates with development environments like VS Code or GitHub, providing developers with rapid, iterative feedback to enhance productivity and code reliability.

The project plan is AI-friendly, featuring a modular design where components can be developed and tested independently using AI tools (e.g., LLMs for agent prompt engineering, code generation). Each phase incorporates AI-assisted steps, such as using local models to prototype agent behaviors, ensuring the development process mirrors the app's AI-centric nature.

## 2. Objectives and Goals
### Primary Objectives:
- Create a multi-agent system with three agents:
  - **Root-Cause Agent**: Analyzes code, logs, and stack traces to pinpoint bug origins (e.g., race conditions, memory leaks).
  - **Fix-Gen Agent**: Generates code patches or refactors based on root-cause insights.
  - **Test-Gen Agent**: Produces unit/integration tests to verify fixes and prevent regressions.
- Orchestrate agents via LangGraph for stateful, graph-based workflows (e.g., conditional routing based on analysis confidence).
- Use local models for privacy, low-latency, and cost-free operation.
- Achieve significant time savings, targeting resolutions in under 15 minutes for complex bugs.

### Secondary Goals:
- Support multiple programming languages (initially Python, C++, JavaScript).
- Integrate with IDEs and VCS for seamless input/output (e.g., debug from GitHub issues).
- Ensure explainability: Agents provide rationales for decisions.
- Make the system extensible for adding more agents (e.g., security scanner).

### Success Metrics:
- Efficiency: Resolve sample bugs in <15 minutes (vs. manual benchmarks).
- Accuracy: 85%+ success rate in fixing verified bugs without introducing new issues.
- Usability: 80%+ developer satisfaction in alpha testing.
- Performance: Handle codebases up to 50k lines with <1-minute per agent cycle.
- Real-World Impact: Replicate quick resolutions like the race condition example.

## 3. Scope
### In-Scope Features:
- **Agent Swarm Workflow**: LangGraph graph defining agent interactions (e.g., root-cause → fix-gen → test-gen loop).
- **Input Handling**: Accept bug descriptions, code diffs, error logs via CLI, API, or IDE extension.
- **Local Model Integration**: Inference with models like Llama 3.1 or Mistral via Ollama.
- **Output Generation**: Patches in diff format, test code, and reports with explanations.
- **Iteration Mechanism**: Agents collaborate iteratively (e.g., re-analyze if tests fail).
- **User Interface**: CLI for quick use; web dashboard for visualizing agent steps.
- **Benchmarking**: Tools to measure resolution time against manual methods.

### Out-of-Scope (for MVP):
- Cloud-based orchestration (focus on local).
- Support for visual debugging (e.g., GUI apps).
- Advanced collaboration (e.g., multi-user sessions).
- Hardware-specific optimizations (assume standard GPU).

### Assumptions:
- Users have debugging basics and access to local LLM setups.
- Local hardware supports multi-agent inference (e.g., 16GB RAM, GPU).
- Open-source libraries for rapid prototyping.

## 4. Technologies and Tools
### Core AI Stack:
- **Framework**: LangGraph (for building stateful multi-agent graphs with nodes as agents and edges as data flows).
- **LLMs**: Local models like Llama 3.1 8B or Mistral 7B (via Ollama for easy deployment).
- **Agent Toolkit**: LangChain for base agent tools (e.g., code interpreters, file readers).

### Development Tools:
- **Languages**: Python (primary for agents and graph).
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI for API exposure; Streamlit for dashboard.
- **Integration**: GitPython for code repo access; Pytest for agent testing.
- **Debugging Aids**: Logging with LangSmith (optional for tracing workflows).
- **Deployment**: Docker for packaging agents and models.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas for log analysis; DiffLib for patch generation.

### AI-Friendly Enhancements:
- Use LLMs for prompt optimization: E.g., "Refine this root-cause prompt for race conditions."
- Agent prototyping: Test individual agents with synthetic bugs via local inference.

## 5. High-Level Architecture
The app uses a graph-based architecture orchestrated by LangGraph:

- **Input Layer**: Parse user inputs (bug report, code snippet) via API/CLI.
- **Agent Swarm Layer**:
  - Root-Cause Agent: Processes input with tools like static analysis.
  - Fix-Gen Agent: Receives cause, generates fixes.
  - Test-Gen Agent: Validates fixes, loops back if needed.
- **State Management**: LangGraph persists shared state (e.g., code versions, analysis results).
- **Output Layer**: Compile final fix, tests, and report.
- **Monitoring**: Trace agent interactions for debugging the debugger.

Diagram (text-based for clarity):
```
[User Input: Bug Report/Code] --> [LangGraph Entry Node] --> [Root-Cause Agent] --> [Fix-Gen Agent] --> [Test-Gen Agent] --> [Validation Loop (if fail)] --> [Output: Patch + Tests]
                                           |                                                                 |
                                           +----------------- Shared State (Code, Logs) -----------------+
```

This design is AI-friendly: Agents can be developed as standalone modules, with LangGraph handling orchestration.
