You are an experienced senior developer and expert in AI.
I want to make an App using AI, so I need you to give me a comprehensive, detailed project plan for this. Make it AI-friendly.
The App idea is this:
"AI Code Reviewer Agent
Built with Llama 3.1 8B (local) + function-calling
Scans PRs, suggests refactors, enforces style guides
92% agreement with human reviews in internal tests"

# AI Code Reviewer Agent Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
The AI Code Reviewer Agent is an intelligent application designed to automate code reviews for pull requests (PRs) in software development workflows. Leveraging a locally hosted Llama 3.1 8B model with function-calling capabilities, the app scans PRs, identifies issues, suggests refactors, and enforces predefined style guides. It aims to achieve high accuracy, with a target of 92% agreement with human reviews based on internal benchmarks. This tool integrates seamlessly with version control systems like GitHub or GitLab, providing developers with actionable feedback to improve code quality, reduce review time, and maintain consistency.

The project is AI-friendly, meaning the plan is structured modularly with clear, self-contained tasks that can be augmented by AI tools (e.g., code generation via LLMs, automated testing scripts). Each phase includes AI-assisted prompts or steps to leverage models like Llama for prototyping and iteration.

## 2. Objectives and Goals
### Primary Objectives:
- Automate PR scanning to detect bugs, inefficiencies, security vulnerabilities, and style violations.
- Provide refactoring suggestions with code snippets and explanations.
- Enforce customizable style guides (e.g., PEP8 for Python, Google Java Style for Java).
- Achieve â‰¥92% agreement with human reviews through fine-tuning and validation.

### Secondary Goals:
- Ensure local deployment for privacy and low-latency (no cloud dependency for core AI).
- Support integration with popular CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Make the app extensible for multi-language support (initially focus on Python, JavaScript, Java).
- Minimize operational costs by running on consumer-grade hardware (e.g., GPU with 8GB VRAM).

### Success Metrics:
- Accuracy: 92%+ concordance in blind tests against human reviewers.
- Performance: Process a 1000-line PR in under 5 minutes.
- Usability: 80%+ user satisfaction in beta testing.
- Adoption: Integrate into at least one open-source repo for real-world validation.

## 3. Scope
### In-Scope Features:
- **PR Integration**: Hook into GitHub/GitLab APIs to fetch PR diffs, comments, and metadata.
- **AI Analysis Engine**: Use Llama 3.1 8B for natural language understanding of code, with function-calling for structured outputs (e.g., calling external linters).
- **Style Enforcement**: Configurable rulesets; auto-suggest fixes.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: Identify anti-patterns and propose optimized code.
- **Reporting**: Generate markdown reports with inline comments, severity levels, and diffs.
- **User Interface**: CLI for local use; optional web dashboard for team reviews.
- **Local Deployment**: Dockerized setup for easy installation.

### Out-of-Scope (for MVP):
- Real-time collaboration (e.g., live editing in PRs).
- Support for exotic languages or binary files.
- Advanced ML training UI (assume pre-fine-tuned model).
- Mobile app version.

### Assumptions:
- Users have basic Git knowledge.
- Hardware supports local LLM inference (e.g., via Ollama or Hugging Face Transformers).
- Open-source libraries are used where possible to keep it AI-friendly for community contributions.

## 4. Technologies and Tools
### Core AI Stack:
- **LLM**: Llama 3.1 8B (local inference via Ollama or Transformers library for efficiency).
- **Function-Calling**: Implement using Llama's tool-use capabilities; define JSON schemas for outputs like "issue_detection", "refactor_suggestion".
- **Fine-Tuning**: Use LoRA adapters on datasets like HumanEval or custom code review pairs.

### Development Tools:
- **Languages**: Python (primary for backend and AI integration).
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI for API endpoints; Streamlit or Gradio for optional UI.
- **Version Control Integration**: PyGitHub or GitLab API libraries.
- **Linters/Static Analyzers**: Integrate via function-calling (e.g., pylint, eslint) for hybrid AI-rule-based checks.
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit tests; custom scripts for accuracy benchmarking.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization; Kubernetes optional for scaling.
- **Data Handling**: Pandas for processing review datasets; SQLAlchemy for logging reviews.

### AI-Friendly Enhancements:
- Use AI code assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot) for boilerplate generation.
- Prompt templates for Llama: E.g., "Analyze this code diff: {diff}. Suggest refactors following {style_guide}."

## 5. High-Level Architecture
The app follows a modular, event-driven architecture:

- **Input Layer**: Webhook listener for PR events (e.g., from GitHub).
- **Processing Layer**:
  - Fetch PR data (diffs, files).
  - Preprocess: Tokenize code, split into chunks for LLM.
  - AI Core: Llama 3.1 processes chunks with function-calls to external tools (e.g., linting APIs).
  - Output Generation: Compile suggestions into structured JSON/markdown.
- **Output Layer**: Post comments to PR, generate reports.
- **Persistence Layer**: SQLite DB for storing review history and metrics.
- **Monitoring**: Logging with Prometheus for performance tracking.

Diagram (text-based for clarity):
```
[PR Webhook] --> [API Endpoint] --> [Preprocessor] --> [Llama 3.1 w/ Function-Calling] --> [Post-Processor] --> [PR Commenter / Report Generator]
                                           |
                                           v
                                 [External Tools: Linters, Static Analyzers]
```

This design is AI-friendly: Modules can be prototyped independently using Llama for mock responses.

## 6. Development Phases
Phased approach with iterative sprints (2-4 weeks each). Total estimated duration: 3-6 months for MVP.

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup (2 weeks)
- Define detailed requirements: User stories (e.g., "As a dev, I want AI suggestions on my PR").
- Set up repo: GitHub with issue templates.
- Install local Llama: Use Ollama to run Llama 3.1 8B; test basic prompts.
- AI-Friendly Step: Generate user stories via prompt: "Create 10 user stories for an AI code reviewer app."

### Phase 2: Core AI Development (4 weeks)
- Implement function-calling: Define tools (e.g., "run_linter(code, language)").
- Build analysis pipeline: Chunk code, prompt Llama for issues/refactors.
- Fine-tune model: Collect dataset (e.g., from public GitHub PRs); use PEFT for efficiency.
- AI-Friendly Step: Use Llama to generate synthetic training data: "Generate 100 code-review pairs with refactors."

### Phase 3: Integration and Features (4 weeks)
- Integrate with GitHub API: Fetch PRs, post comments.
- Add style guide enforcement: Config YAML for rules; hybrid AI + rule-based.
- Develop reporting: Markdown templates with diffs.
- AI-Friendly Step: Auto-generate API wrappers: Prompt for "Write Python code to fetch GitHub PR diff."

### Phase 4: UI and UX (2 weeks)
- Build CLI: Commands like `ai-review pr --id=123`.

- **Risk**: Performance issues on local hardware.
  - Mitigation: Optimize with quantization; fallback to smaller models.
- **Risk**: Data privacy in PRs.
  - Mitigation: Local-only processing; no cloud uploads.
- **Risk**: Achieving 92% accuracy.
  - Mitigation: Iterative fine-tuning; use diverse datasets.

## 10. Testing and Evaluation
- **Unit Tests**: 80% code coverage.
- **Integration Tests**: Simulate PR webhooks.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Use Cohen's Kappa for agreement with human reviews; target 0.85+ score.
- **User Testing**: Beta with 10 developers; surveys for feedback.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Log reviews for retraining Llama.

This plan is designed to be executable step-by-step, with AI integration at every level to accelerate development. Start with Phase 1 setup for quick wins.
